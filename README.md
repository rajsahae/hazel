My code-along with TheCherno Hazel Engine

TheCherno's Game Engine Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT

His series is initially designed for Windows only. I will be working along in MacOS.
I started out using SCons for the build system, but at episode 6 I switched over to make, when he started using premake.
I am not using Visual Studio here, so any Visual Studio specific items are not included in the repo.
