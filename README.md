My code-along with TheCherno Hazel Engine

TheCherno's Game Engine Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT

His series is initially designed for Windows only. I will be working along in MacOS, using SCons for the build system. Hopefully
this leads to me being able to contribute directly to his project while still building on MacOS and/or Linux but NOT using Visual
Studio.
